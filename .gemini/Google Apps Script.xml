# Code Guidelines
All functional code must be written in Javascript with .js file extensions using ES6+ syntax for the V8 runtime with JSDoc documentation strings for all functions. 

# Library Guidelines
If specific Javascript libraries are required, they must be documented in the npm package.json file. Libraries should be used sparingly and only when necessary, containing all functional code within the .js files is preferred. 

# File Organization Guidelines
All supporting functions, including their JSDoc documentation strings, must be written in a single .js file named @utils.js. The main .gs file should only contain the main function and any necessary function calls.
